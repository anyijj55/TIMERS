# TIMERS
Timers are one of the most essential and widely used functions in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). They are used to introduce time-based control in automation processes, such as delaying an action, controlling the duration of an operation, or scheduling repetitive tasks. Below is a detailed technical explanation of timers in PLCs: 

 

Timers in PLCs 

Overview of Timers 

Timers in PLCs are digital counters that count time-based intervals, measured in seconds or milliseconds. They are used to control operations that require precise timing, such as: 

Delaying the start or stop of a motor. 

Controlling the duration of a process (e.g., heating, mixing). 

Implementing safety delays (e.g., holding a door open for a specific time). 

Timers are programmed using ladder logic or other PLC programming languages and are categorized into different types based on their functionality. 

 

Types of Timers in PLCs 

There are three main types of timers used in PLC programming: 

On-Delay Timer (TON): Starts timing when the input condition becomes true (e.g., a switch is turned on). The output is activated only after the preset time has elapsed. 

Off-Delay Timer (TOF): Starts timing when the input condition becomes false (e.g., a switch is turned off). The output remains active until the preset time has elapsed. 

Retentive Timer (RTO): Accumulates time whenever the input condition is true, even if the condition becomes false intermittently. The timer retains its accumulated value and continues counting when the input condition becomes true again.
